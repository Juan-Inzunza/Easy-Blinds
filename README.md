# Easy-Blinds
CSE 308 & 408 Computer Engineering Design Project

This project in CSE308 consisted of windows blinds connected to a servo which would open and close the blinds according to readings from a motion, temperature, light, and IR Remote Control. 

Later in CSE408, the project was updated to include an Android app and Alexa to control the blinds state for the user's preference.
